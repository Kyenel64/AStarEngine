# AStar Engine
![AStar Engine Logo](AStarLogo_Github.png "AStar")
<br /> AStar Engine is a CUDA Raytracing engine using OpenGL. The engine is being developed as I learn ray tracing conecpts, so the code is probably not written/optimized properly.

<br />Dependencies:
<br />- GLFW
<br />- GLAD
<br />- KHR
